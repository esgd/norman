			<h2 id="counts-rollo" class="article-head"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo"> 1. Rollo "the Viking" 911–927</a></h2>
			<p class="content first-p">
			Rollo was born in the latter half of the 9th century somewhere in Scandinavia. 
			Details of his origins and parentage are obscure.</p>
				<p class="content sub">
				i. Rollo's grandson, Richard I of Normandy, commissioned the cleric Dudo, of Saint-Quentin, in 994 
				to write Rollo's biography. 
				Rollo (c. 846 – c. 930) was a Viking who became the first ruler of Normandy, a region of France. 
				He emerged as the outstanding personality among the Norsemen who had secured a permanent foothold 
				on Frankish soil in the valley of the lower Seine. Charles the Simple, the king of West Francia, 
				ceded them lands between the mouth of the Seine and what is now the city of Rouen in exchange for Rollo 
				agreeing to end his brigandage, and provide the Franks with his protection against further 
				incursion by Norse war bands.[1]</p>

				<p class="content sub">
				ii. The only earlier source for Rollo's origins is the 10th-century French chronicler Richer of Reims 
				who refers to Rollo as the son of Ketill, presumably the same Ketill whom he names as the chief of the 
				Viking raiders against Gaul between the Seine and the Loire in 888.[5]</p>

			<p class="content">
			Later sources, being more distant in time and place from the arrival of Rollo in Normandy, would normally 
			be considered less trustworthy by historians, but in this case a number of modern historians have favoured 
			certain later sources in preferring Norway to Denmark as the origin of Rollo.[6] Geoffrey Malaterra, 
			an eleventh-century Benedictine monk and historian, wrote how: "Rollo sailed boldly from Norway with his fleet 
			to the Christian coast."[7]</p>
			<p class="content">The 12th century English historian William of Malmesbury, stated that, <strong>Rollo 
			was "born of noble lineage among the Norwegians".</strong>[8]<br>
			Rollo also is mentioned in "The Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan", 
			an anonymous 12th century Welsh biography, where the genealogy of Gruffyd's grandfather, includes Rollo as 
			a brother of King Harald Finehair of Norway.[9]</p>
			<p class="content">
			The 13th century Icelandic sagas, Heimskringla and Orkneyinga Saga, 
			portray him as <em><strong>Hrólf the Walker</strong> ("who was so big that no horse could carry him",</em> hence his byname of Ganger-Hrólf[10]), 
			but these offer a different account of his parentage, claiming that Rollo was born as Hrólfr Rognvaldsson in Møre, Western Norway, 
			in the late 9th century as a son to the Norwegian jarl Rognvald Eysteinsson.</p>
			
			<p class="content sub">**NOTE: In the Film, "The Hobbit":<br>
			<em>the Ranger from the North</em> is thought to reference<br>
			<em>Rollo ... "the Walker"</em></p>

			<p class="content last">
			Rollo is first recorded as the leader of these Viking settlers in a charter of 918, and 
			he continued to reign over the region of Normandy until at least 928.<br>
			He was succeeded by his son, William Longsword, in the Duchy of Normandy, that he had founded.<br>
			<br>			
			<strong>The offspring of Rollo and his men became known as the Normans.</strong> 
			After the Norman conquest of England and their conquest of southern Italy and Sicily over the following two centuries, 
			the descendants of Rollo and his men came to rule Norman England (the House of Normandy), 
			the Kingdom of Sicily (the Kings of Sicily) as well as the Principality of Antioch from the 10th to 12th century, 
			leaving behind an enduring legacy in the historical developments of Europe and the Near East.[2]</p>

			2. William I Longsword, Count of Rouen  927–942</a></h2>
			
			<p class="content first-p">
			He is sometimes anachronistically dubbed "Duke of Normandy", even though the title duke (dux) did not come into common 
			usage until the 11th century.[2]<br>
			Longsword was known at the time by the title Count (Latin comes) of Rouen.[3][4]<br> 
			<p class="first-p sub">Flodoard—always detailed about titles—consistently referred to both Rollo and his son William as principes (chieftains) 
			of the Norse.[5]</p>
			
			<p class="content">William Longsword was born "overseas"[a][6] 
			to the Viking Rollo (while he was still a pagan) and his Christian wife Poppa of Bayeux.[7][8]<br>
			Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his panegyric of the Norman dukes describes Poppa, as the daughter of a Count Beranger, 
			the dominant prince of that region.[9]</p>
			
			<p class="content">In the 11th century Annales Rouennaises (Annals of Rouen), she is called <em>the daughter of Guy,</em> 
			Count of Senlis,[10] otherwise unknown to history.[b]<br>
			Despite the uncertainty of her parentage she was a member of the Frankish aristocracy.[11]<br>
			According to the Longsword's planctus, he was baptized a Christian, probably at the same time as 
			his father,[12] which, Orderic Vitalis stated was in 912, by Franco, Archbishop of Rouen.[13]</p>

			<p class="content sub"><span>WIFE:</span>
			Longsword had no children with his wife Luitgarde.[31] He fathered his son, Richard the Fearless, with Sprota [c] who was a Breton 
			captive and his concubine.[32] Richard, then aged 10, succeeded him as Duke of Normandy in December 942.[31]</p>

			<p class="content sub"><span>SPROTA,</span> was the name of a Breton captive, who William I, Duke of Normandy took as a wife in the Viking fashion (more danico)[1][2]<br>
			and by her had a son, Richard I, Duke of Normandy. After the death of her husband William, she became the wife of Esperleng and 
			mother of Rodulf of Ivry.[3][4][5]</p>

			<p class="content">Longsword pledged his loyalty to King Louis IV, when they met in 940 and, in return, he was confirmed in lands that had been given 
			to his father, Rollo.[30] [23]:liii</p>
			
			<p class="content">In 941 a peace treaty was signed between the Britons and Normans, 
			brokered in Rouen, by King Louis IV, which limited the Norman expansion into Briton lands.[23]:liii</p>
			
			<p class="content last">The following year, on 17 December 942, at Picquigny, on an island on the Somme, Longsword was ambushed 
			and killed by followers of Arnulf, while at a peace conference to settle their differences.[18][28]

			<h2 id="counts-richard" class="article-head"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo">3. Richard I the Fearless 942–996</a></h2>
			
			<p class="content first-p">
			With the death of Richard's father in 942, King Louis IV of France installed the boy, Richard, in his father's office. 
			Under the influence of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders the King took him into Frankish territory [9]:32–4. 
			Placing him in the custody of the Count of Ponthieu, before the King reneged and seized the lands of the Duchy of Normandy.[10]</p> 
			
			<p class="content">
			He then split up the Duchy, giving its lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis IV thereafter kept Richard in 
			close confinement at Lâon,[11]<br>
			But, the youth escaped from imprisonment [9]:36–7 with assistance of Osmond de Centville, 
			Bernard de Senlis (who had been a companion of Rollo of Normandy), Ivo de Bellèsme and Bernard the Dane[12].</p>

			<p class="content sub">
			In 946, at the age of 14, Richard allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders in France and with men sent by King Harold of Denmark. 
			A battle was fought after which the Louis IV was captured. Hostages were taken and held until King Louis recognised Richard as Duke, 
			returning Normandy to him.[9]:37–41<br>
			Richard agreed to "commend" himself to Hugh, the Count of Paris, Hugh resolved to form a 
			permanent alliance with Richard and promised his daughter Emma, who was just a child, as a bride, 
			the marriage would take place in 960.[9]:41–2</p>

			<p class="content sub">
			For the last 30 years until his death in 996 in Fécamp, Richard concentrated on Normandy itself, 
			and participated less in Frankish politics and its petty wars. In lieu of building up the Norman Empire by expansion, 
			he stabilized the realm and reunited the Normans, forging the reclaimed Duchy of his father and grandfather into West Francia's most cohesive and 
			formidable principality.[17]</p>

			<p class="content last">Richard was succeeded in November 996 by his 33-year-old son, Richard II, Duke of Normandy.</p>
