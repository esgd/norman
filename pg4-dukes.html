					the first five years of Richard's reign, his regent was, Count Rodulf of Ivry, his uncle.</em></p>
					
					<p class="content">Richard had deep religious interests and found he had much in common 
					with Robert II of France, who he helped militarily against the duchy of Burgundy.[3] 
					He forged a marriage alliance with Brittany, by marrying his sister Hawise,
					to Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany &amp; by his own marriage to Geoffrey's sister, 
					Judith of Brittany.[3]</p>
					
					<p class="content">Richard attempted to improve relations with England through his sister,
					Emma of Normandy's marriage to King Ethelred.[4] <em>This marriage was significant 
					in that it later gave his grandson, William the Conqueror, the 
					basis of his claim to the throne of England.</em>[7]</p>

					<p class="content">When Richard II died in August 1026, his eldest son, 
					Richard III, became Duke of Normandy.[1]<br>
					<em>Richard's short reign lasted less than a year.</em></p> 
					
					<p class="content">It opened with a revolt by his brother &amp; finished in his death <em>by unknown causes.</em></p>
					
					<p class="content">Around 1020, Richard's father sent him in command of a large army to rescue his 
					brother-in-law, Reginald, later Count of Burgundy, by attacking bishop &amp; 
					Count Hugh of Chalon, who had captured and imprisoned Reginald.[2]</p>
					
					<p class="content">Shortly after his reign began his brother Robert, discontented with his province of Hiemois 
					on the border of Normandy, revolted against his brother. He laid siege to the town of Falaise, 
					but was soon brought to heel by Richard who captured him, then released him on his oath of fealty.
					No sooner had Richard disbanded his army and returned to Rouen, when <em>he died suddenly (some say suspiciously).</em> 
					The duchy passed to his younger brother Robert I.[3]

						</ol>					
					
					<p class="content">He was the son of Richard II of Normandy and Judith, daughter of Conan I, 
					Duke of Brittany. He was also grandson of Richard I of Normandy, 
					great-grandson of William I of Normandy and great-great grandson of Rollo, 
					the Viking, who founded Normandy. Before he died, Richard II had decided his 
					elder son, Richard III, would succeed him while his second son Robert would 
					become Count of Hiémois.[1] 
					</p>
					<p class="content">When Richard III died a year later, there were suspicions that Robert had 
					something to do with his death. Although nothing could be proved, 
					Robert had the most to gain.[3] The civil war Robert I had brought against 
					his brother Richard III was still causing instability in the duchy.[3] 
					Private wars raged between neighbouring barons. This resulted in a new aristocracy 
					arising in Normandy during Robert’s reign.[3]

				<h2 id="william-i" class="article-head">William I <span class="smaller">("the Conqueror", King of England)</span> 1035–1087</h2>
					<p class="content">William I (Old Norman: Williame I; Old English: Willelm I; c. 1028[1] – 9 September 1087), 
					usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard,[2][a] 
					was the <em>first Norman King of England,</em> reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087.<br>
					A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as Duke William II) from 1035 onward. 
					After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, 
					and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later. 
					The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and 
					his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son.
					</p>
					<p class="content">William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. 
					His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, 
					as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, 
					members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and 
					for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his 
					authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. 
					His marriage in the 1050s to <em>Matilda of Flanders,</em> provided him with a powerful ally,
					in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange 
					the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. 
					His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to 
					secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine.

				<h2 class="article-head">Robert Curthose 1087-1106</h2>
					<p class="content">Robert Curthose[1] (c.?1051 – 3 February 1134), sometimes styled Robert II or Robert III, 
					was the Duke of Normandy from 1087 until 1106 and an <em>unsuccessful claimant</em> to the throne 
					of the Kingdom of England.
					</p>
					<p class="content">Robert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, 
					and Matilda of Flanders, and a participant in the First Crusade. His reign as Duke is noted 
					for the discord with his brothers in England, eventually leading to his death in captivity 
					and the absorption of Normandy as a possession of England.

					<p class="content">William II (Old Norman: Williame II; c.?1056 – 2 August 1100), 
					the third son of William I of England, was King of England from 
					1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. 
					He was less successful in extending control into Wales. 
					William is commonly known as William Rufus or William the Red, 
					perhaps because of his red-faced appearance.[2]
					</p>
					<p class="content">He was a figure of complex temperament: capable of both bellicosity 
					and flamboyance. He did not marry, nor did he produce any offspring, 
					legitimate or otherwise. He died after being struck by an arrow while hunting, 
					under circumstances that remain murky. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour 
					of those around him raise strong but unproven suspicions of murder. 
					His younger brother Henry hurriedly succeeded him as king.

						<p class="content">William Clito (25 October 1102 – 28 July 1128) reigned as Count of Flanders 
						and claimed the Duchy of Normandy. His surname "Clito" was a Latin term 
						equivalent to the Anglo-Saxon "Aetheling" and the Germanic "Adelinus" 
						(used to refer to his first cousin, William Adelin).</p>
						
						<p>Both terms signified "man of royal blood" or, the modern equivalent, 
						"prince".</p>
						
						<p class="content">William was the son of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, by his marriage 
						to Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano.[1] 
						After his defeat and capture by Henry I of England at the Battle of Tinchebrai 
						(1106), Robert Curthose accompanied his brother Henry I to Falaise where Henry 
						met his nephew the young William Clito for the first time.[2] Henry placed his 
						nephew in the custody of Helias of Saint Saens, Count of Arques, who had 
						married a natural daughter of Duke Robert, his friend and patron.[3]</p>
						
						<p class="content">The boy William stayed in his sister’s and Helias's care until August 1110, 
						when the king abruptly sent agents to demand the boy be handed over to him.[4] 
						Helias was at the time away from home, so his household concealed the boy and 
						smuggled him to their master, who fled the duchy and found safety among 
						Henry's enemies.[4]

						from 1100 to his death. Henry was the <em>fourth son of William the Conqueror</em> and was 
						educated in Latin and the liberal arts. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers 
						Robert Curthose and William Rufus inherited Normandy and England, respectively, but 
						Henry was left landless. Henry purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert, 
						but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. Henry gradually rebuilt his power base in the
						Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert.</p> 
						
						<p class="content">Henry was present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, 
						promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. 
						Henry married Matilda of Scotland but continued to have a large number of mistresses, 
						by whom he had many illegitimate children.
